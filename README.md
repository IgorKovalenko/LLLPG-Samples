# The Loyc LL(k) Parser Generator (LLLPG)

Articles about LLLPG are published on the [home page](http://ecsharp.net/lllpg/).

This repo contains the following demos:

- Boilerplate (a very simple two-stage parser - good starting point for your own parsers)
- Calculator demo (standalone)
- Calculator demo (based on Loyc libraries)
- Calculator demo (produces [Loyc trees](https://github.com/qwertie/LoycCore/wiki/Loyc-trees))
- Enhanced C# parser (generally NOT kept up-to-date)
- JSON parser and printer

Please get LLLPG itself from [the ecsharp repo](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/releases). See also: [installation instructions](http://ecsharp.net/lemp/install.html)
